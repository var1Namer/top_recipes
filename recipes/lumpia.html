        <h2 class="descrip">Description</h2>
        <p class="descrip des">Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and
            Indonesian cuisines. The rolls traditionally feature a thin pastry
            skin (a.k.a. a lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory
            mixture of ground pork and vegetables.</p>
        <h2 class="ingl">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup minced carrots</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped green onions</li>
            <li>½ cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro--optional</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>

        <ol class="steps des">
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large
                skillet over high heat. Add pork; cook and stir until
                crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pork
                from the pan and set aside. Drain grease from the pan,
                leaving just a thin coating.</li>
            <li>Add onion and garlic to the pan; cook and stir until fragrant,
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in cooked pork, carrots, green onions, cabbage, and
                cilantro. Season with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce.
                Remove from the heat, and set aside until cool enough to handle,
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>To assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally
                near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 ½ inch space at both
                ends.</li>
            <li>Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in
                both ends, and roll neatly and tightly to close.</li>
            <li>Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Transfer to
                a plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Repeat to assemble remaining
                lumpia.</li>
        </ol>
