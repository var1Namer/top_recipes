    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fish sinigang (Sinigang na Isda) is a popular Filipino sour and savory soup
        featuring fish cooked in a tart broth, typically soured with tamarind (sampaloc)
        or other fruits like guava or calamansi, alongside various vegetables such as water
        spinach (kangkong), radish, and eggplant, and served hot with rice. It's known for its
        comforting, tangy flavor profile, making it a beloved comfort food. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound tilapia fillets, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 small head bok choy, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced daikon radish</li>
        <li>¼ cup tamarind paste</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2 dried red chile peppers--Optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, combine the tilapia, bok choy,
            and radish. Stir together the tamarind paste and water;
            pour into the pot. Toss in the chili peppers if using. Bring
            to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes, or just until the fish is
            cooked through. Even frozen fish will cook in less than 10 minutes.
            Do not over cook or else the fish will fall apart. Ladle into bowls to
            serve.</li>
    </ol>
